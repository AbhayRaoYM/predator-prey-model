# predator-prey-model
🐟🐻 Predator-Prey Model: Fish vs Bears  This project simulates the Predator-Prey relationship between fish (prey) and bears (predator) using the Lotka–Volterra equations.  The goal is to demonstrate how predator and prey populations naturally oscillate over time, and to visualize these dynamics using Python-based modeling and data visualization.
